# Plasma Help
A centralized service to get help about blood and plasma donations.

## Why Use This?
In this time of covid-19 epidemic, there is a global shortage of oxygen and blood plasma.
People are asking for help in social medias but people aren't getting help in time and the
help is unorganized. So me and the team decided to create **PlasmaHelp** for the sole 
purpose of organizing the help and making the help accessible to more people easily.
